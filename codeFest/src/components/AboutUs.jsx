            At Marriott, our mission is to provide guests with seamless access to resources and amenities, <br />
            eliminating the common stresses of vacation planning. From finding the perfect hotel and<br />
            navigating transportation options to exploring nearby dining and planning family-friendly activities,<br />
            we understand the challenges involved. That’s why we’ve developed a Destination Calculator, designed <br />
            to simplify the process. Customers can input their preferences, and we will suggest ideal travel <br />
            destinations, while also offering information on accommodations, activities, and more—ensuring<br />
            they enjoy the luxury and relaxation they deserve. <br />
